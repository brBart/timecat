# timecat
This is a time-tracking and invoice-creation software. It was designed for, and used by, a four-person law firm for a couple of years. I still use it for my law practice.  The license is GPL 2.0 or later. PHP and javascript with PostgreSQL as a back end. If you want to see a live demo, or need help getting it set up, send me a message.
